# picnicSTL
PicnicSTL - have you wished there was an STL like Python's standard library? 

Enough of lambdas, autos, crazy iterators? You just need simple, raw features? 

Well, no shit! This is it right here. 

Rules:
- The interface will copy as much as it can from python 2.7 standard library so developers can intuitively use features
- No external, additional dependencies like boost
- Straightforward C++ - this means no "advanced" techniques that a high-school cheerleader can't read
- No exceptions - no exceptions
- In between performance and features, features win
- In between features and usability, usability wins

We will focus on the [[Python 2.7 Library]](https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/) for spiritual guidance as well as shamelessly stealing code, if not the entire damn library

And last but not least, goes without saying: /s
- my code, my rules
- ! means not
- all files matter
- check your commit privilege
