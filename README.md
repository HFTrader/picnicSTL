# picnicSTL
PicnicSTL - have you wished there was an STL like Python's standard library? 

Enough of lambdas, autos, crazy iterators? You just need simple, raw features? 

Well, no shit! This is it right here. 

Rules:
- The interface will copy as much as it can from python 2.7 standard library so developers can intuitively use features
- No external, additional dependencies like boost
- Straightforward C++ - this means no "advanced" techniques that a high-school cheerleader can't read
